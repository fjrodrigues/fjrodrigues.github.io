						In this fiction, the leading character craves for a
						world where all the darkness in his life no longer
						exists. In order to build this world, he decrees an
						expiration date for all his negative memories. Being
						able to select his memories, he is his own god, being
						able to manipulate his reality, living in a nostalgic
						time, in this unreal world he imagines, where there are
						no bad experiences and everything is a utopia. At first,
						living in this world seems like living for the first
						time, but later, the leading character falls into a void
						of emptiness. His identity was taken by all the
						repudiated memories. He is no longer living. There’s no
						past, present or future. Just emptiness.

							The City, Love, and Despair marks the first of a
							four-part series of videos delving into the story of
							Anachronic Stamp. As a starting point, the video
							explores the origins and the emergence of the
							feelings that lead the main character through a path
							of blind destruction. At the core of this act, love
							or severe infatuation is found as the main reason
							for the anguish that the character feels, living
							each and every day consumed by it, failing to gather
							any kind of reciprocation. Exploring deeper into his
							mindset, the city and his relation with it, marks a
							crucial aspect as to understand the atmosphere on
							which he is enveloped. Feeling lost and isolated in
							conjunction with a hopeless pursuit for an
							unrequited love induces in him a deep state of
							despair and an intense longing for change. Not being
							able to handle this way of living, and after much
							consideration, the character defines a date for the
							erasure of the memories pertaining to his loved-one.
							As the elements that guide us and connect the video,
							the mementos or knickknacks that he collects take on
							two meanings for the character: they not only become
							elements that ground him, reminders of the time
							elapsed in the city, but soon enough they also
							become painful signs of his shortcomings concerning
							his love. More so, in this narrative, these objects
							become true symbols of its inception: material
							objects in a direction of increasing alienation and
							of complete distortion of reality.

							Nostalgia, A Dissolving Harbor embodies the second
							part of a series of videos that seek to spawn
							individual perspectives on the fiction Anachronic
							Stamp — an adaptation of Wong Kar-wai’s Chungking
							Express. Dwelling in the idea of nostalgia and
							yearning for a vanished place, the entry of the
							video is set after the erasure of all memories
							pertaining to the main character’s loved-one. The
							inaugural seconds of the video evoke the feeling of
							displacement and damaging disorientation felt by the
							character, whose only tie to the city he lives in
							was the now-erased love. Abruptly dislodged by his
							surroundings, the character is possessed by a deep
							feeling of nostalgia regarding a near past. The
							following part of the video portrays the character’s
							memories of this place and their magnification. The
							fluctuation of the soundscape and the colors sustain
							an unlike and somewhat unapproachable atmosphere.
							This is a craved yet unobtainable place and time.

							feelings which were represented to make the
							spectator feel the transition between a first

							of this video, the camera goes up again, showing the
							place where he is lastly, the city, where the

							Memory serves us as a landmark of personal
							experiences that are open to interpretation and
							reframe the past, not as a fixed narrative, but as a
							multiplicity of voices from diverse points of view.
							This allows us to think about our personal stories,
							how we might document things to come. We have all
							experienced the feeling of being suddenly
							transported to our past and reviving intense,
							emotional memories triggered by a whatsoever
							stimulus. This phenomenon, usually described by
							sense memories, tackles an altogether framework of
							personal accounts. But, what if, one has already
							lost the ability to understand, connect and
							intertwine the frames evoked by such process? What
							if, due to a succession of voluntary erasures of
							memories, one is left only with intermittent breaks
							of consciousness, often triggered by senses? The
							result would probably be a recollection of
							involuntary strong emotional reactions that
							intercross each other. Having lost the ability to
							bridge the gaps, cognitive functions would be
							eroded, and the loss of identity would surely settle
							in. We would rummage through a heap of trash, a pile
							of disconnected, fractured reminiscences. It would
							be as if life had become an ephemeral concept, which
							never even existed in a fixed space or time and
							seemed to disappear entirely when not being
							performed as we know it. Inner specters, Outer
							spectators stands as the last but one part of the
							five-section fiction Anachronic Stamp.
